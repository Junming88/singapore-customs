# Re-importing of Goods Sent Overseas for Activities

Goods sent overseas may be re-imported into Singapore due to:

-   Re-import of temporary exported goods for approved purposes including repair, performances and exhibition
-   Re-import of goods stored or used in a Free Trade Zone
-   Return of damaged or rejected goods

Similar to imports, all re-imports of goods into Singapore incur Goods and Services Tax (GST) and/or duty payments. You may find out more about  [duties](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-and-fees/duties-and-dutiable-goods) and [GST](/businesses/valuation-duties-taxes-fees/goods-and-services-tax-gst).
