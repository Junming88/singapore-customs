## How to cancel a Certificate of Origin?

A CO that is not utilised shall be returned to Singapore Customs with a cover letter stating the request for cancellation. You may send through mail or drop it at the drop box located at:

Tariffs and Trade Services Branch (Rules of Origin Unit)  
Singapore Customs  
55 Newton Road #02-01  
Revenue House  
Singapore 307987

## How to cancel an Electronic Prefrential Certificate of Origin (ePCO)

For ePCOs, you will not be able to make any amendments to the electronic PCO after you have successfully submitted to the respective importing authorities of the country. Therefore, you should inform your importer not to quote the first ePCO number in their import declaration and instead, you should provide the new ePCO reference number to your importer. Next, please write in to Singapore Customs at customs_roo@customs.gov.sg, within 7 days of the transmission of the new ePCO, with the following details:

-   Electronic PCO reference number to be cancelled

-   Reason for cancellation for the PCO

-   New PCO reference number

## How to amend a Certificate of Origin?

You may amend a CO electronically via TradeNet if:

-   The CO is applied together with an export permit at the time of application;
    
-   The export permit is still valid; and
    
-   The field which you wish to amend in the CO is an amendable field in the export permit
    

If the amendment is made after the CO has been generated for printing, all previously issued COs under the export permit will be considered null and void and must be returned to Singapore Customs for cancellation. A new CO number will be issued and the CO can be collected 2 working hours after approval.
