## How to cancel a Certificate of Origin?

All requests for cancellation of CO and Preferential CO (PCO) issued by Customs shall be submitted online via FormSG. Do note that only unutilised CO/PCOs can be cancelled. Upon the submission of the FormSG, the CO/PCOs will automatically be deemed as cancelled unless advised otherwise by Customs within the next 7 days. The cancelled hardcopy CO is not required to be returned to Customs.

To submit the CO for cancellation, please fill in the FormSG which can be accessed through this [link](go.gov.sg/cancellationofco).

For more information, please refer to [Notice 19/2020](/news-and-media/notices/2020-12-31-N.pdf).


## How to cancel an Electronic Prefrential Certificate of Origin (ePCO)

For ePCOs, you will not be able to make any amendments to the electronic PCO after you have successfully submitted to the respective importing authorities of the country. Therefore, you should inform your importer not to quote the first ePCO number in their import declaration and instead, you should provide the new ePCO reference number to your importer. Next, please write in to Singapore Customs at customs_roo@customs.gov.sg within 7 days of the transmission of the new ePCO, with the following details:

-   Electronic PCO reference number to be cancelled

-   Reason for cancellation for the PCO

-   New PCO reference number

## How to amend a Certificate of Origin?

You may amend a CO electronically via TradeNet if:

-   The CO is applied together with an export permit at the time of application;
    
-   The export permit is still valid; and
    
-   The field which you wish to amend in the CO is an amendable field in the export permit
    

If the amendment is made after the CO has been generated for printing, all previously issued COs under the export permit will be considered null and void and must be returned to Singapore Customs for cancellation. A new CO number will be issued and the CO can be collected 2 working hours after approval.
