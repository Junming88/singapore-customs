## Electronic submission of the ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) via the ASEAN Single Window (ASW)

The ASEAN Single Window (ASW) is a regional initiative that connects and integrates the National Single Windows (NSWs) of ASEAN Member States (AMS), thereby allowing the electronic exchange of data between the AMS. You may submit an ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) if you are exporting to: <br><br>
    •	Cambodia<br>
    •	Myanmar

The ACDD is an electronic document containing a specific set of export permit data for the purpose of supplementing risk management by the Customs administration in the importing country.

The expected benefits for participating traders include potential reduction in Customs clearance time for consignments which are supported by the ACDD and imported into an exchange-ready AMS. The specific TradeNet export permit data that would be sent as an ACDD to an exchange-ready AMS are:<br><br>

  a)	Exporter UEN<br>
  b)	Exporter Company Name<br>
  c)	Consignee Company Name<br>
  d)	Consignee Company Address<br>
  e)	Declaring Agent UEN<br>
  f)	Declaring Agent Company Name<br>
  g)	Departure Date<br>
  h)	Item HS Code<br>
  i)	Item HS Quantity<br>
  j)	Item HS Quantity UOM<br>
  k)	Item Country of Origin of Goods<br>
  l)	Outward Transport Mode<br>
  m)	Port of Discharge<br>
  n)	Serial Number of Item; and<br>
  o)	TradeNet Permit Number.<br>

## Participation and ASEAN exchange of ACDD

**Step 1: Participation in the ASEAN Exchange of ACDD and Authorisation of Declaring Agent for ACDD**<br><br>
The ACDD is open to all traders who export goods to any exchange-ready AMS. Traders who wish to participate in the exchange of ACDD can indicate their participation and authorise their Declaring Agent(s) to provide consent to Singapore Customs to send the ACDD to the exchange-ready AMS. The ACDD participation form can be accessed from the [ASEAN Customs Declaration Document (ACDD) section on the Customs Forms and Service Links page](https://www.customs.gov.sg/eservices/customs-forms-and-service-links).

**Step 2: TradeNet Declaration Procedures**<br><br> 
There will be no change to the TradeNet permit application procedures. To authorise Singapore Customs to send the ACDD to the exchange-ready AMS (specified in the “country of final destination” field in the export permit), the Declaring Agent has to:<br><br>

  a)	Select “International Permit Exchange” under the “Customs Procedure Code (CPC)” field; and<br>
  b)	Key in “ACDD” at the “Procedure Code 1 (PC1)” field.
